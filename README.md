Type in the metric (there are three example metrics, the FLRW in general universes, in flat universes and a test metric with time dependent curvature.)
The method "EinsteinEq" needs the metric and its inverse and returns the "left hand side" of the einstein equations. (The side with the metrics.)

To use this, Mathematica is needed.
